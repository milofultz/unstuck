# Unstuck

Simple CLI app to prompt you towards finding solutions and work smarter, not harder.

This "app" is not robust and doesn't have much in terms of error checking. If you find an error, tell me and I'll fix it, but it's `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` at the moment.

## Installation

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python3 unstuck.py`
